# If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
-> BFS

# If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
-> BFS (DFS takes too much time)

# If the tree is very wide:
-> DFS (BFS takes too much memory)

# If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
-> DFS

# Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
-> DFS

# Finding the shortest path:
-> BFS
